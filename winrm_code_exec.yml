# RULE 1
# In this first part of the rule, we find what looks
# like a process executing with the expected command
# line parameter that would trigger the XSL load.
# If we detect it, we task the agent to send us
# all the events in recent history, which will include
# all file creation.
# Then we set a tag for two minutes essentially
# saying "be on the lookup for the relevant XSL files
# being created".

# RULE 2
# In the second part, we wait to see a sensor with
# the "lookout" tag enabled and a file getting created
# with the relevant names. If we see it we report.
