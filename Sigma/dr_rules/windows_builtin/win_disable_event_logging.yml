    description: 'Detects scenarios where system auditing (ie: windows event log auditing)
      is disabled. This may be used in a scenario where an entity would want to bypass
      local logging to evade detection when windows event logging is enabled and reviewed.
      Also, it is recommended to turn off "Local Group Policy Object Processing" via
      GPO, which will make sure that Active Directory GPOs take precedence over local/edited
      computer policies via something such as "gpedit.msc". Please note, that disabling
      "Local Group Policy Object Processing" may cause an issue in scenarios of one
      off specific GPO modifications -- however it is recommended to perform these
      modifications in Active Directory anyways.'
