# Sigma Rules
These are LimaCharlie [D&R rules](https://doc.limacharlie.io/en/master/dr/) generated by
the LimaCharlie backend for [Sigma](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma).

If you want to generate them yourself, from this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/refractionPOINT/sigma
python3 ./generate_all.py
```

The rules are not authored by the LimaCharlie team, to find the original
rule and author see [the originals](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/tree/master/rules).

Many of the rules for Windows are based on Windows Event Logs. These are not collected by
LimaCharlie by default, but they can be collected automatically using the [External Logs](https://doc.limacharlie.io/en/master/external_logs/)
service. Most Windows Event Logs are located in: `c:\windows\system32\winevt\logs\`.
