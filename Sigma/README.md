# Sigma Rules
These are LimaCharlie [D&R rules](https://doc.limacharlie.io/en/master/dr/) generated by
the LimaCharlie backend for [Sigma](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma).

If you want to generate them yourself, from this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/refractionPOINT/sigma
python3 ./generate_all.py
```

The rules are not authored by the LimaCharlie team, to find the original
rule and author see [the originals](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/tree/master/rules).
